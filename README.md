# WebFlux

## Installation

This project requires [Node JS](https://nodejs.org) in order to work and [Node Package Manager](https://npmjs.org) to install packages.
When installing NodeJS, NPM should be installed automatically as well.

Then, go to the `web-flux` folder:

```
npm install
```

## Start-up

```
npm start
```

By default, WebFlux starts on port 80, but you can change it by using `set PORT=3000 && npm start` .
